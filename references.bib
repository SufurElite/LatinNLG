Most previous works on automatic Chinese poetry generation focused on improving the coherency among lines. Some work explored style transfer but suffered from expensive expert labeling of poem styles. In this paper, we target on stylistic poetry generation in a fully unsupervised manner for the first time. We propose a novel model which requires no supervised style labeling by incorporating mutual information, a concept in information theory, into modeling. Experimental results show that our model is able to generate stylistic poems without losing fluency and coherency.",

To produce text that may be regarded as poetry, poetry generation systems are typically knowledge-intensive and have to deal with several levels of language, from lexical to semantics. Interest on the topic resulted in the development of several poetry generators described in the literature, with different features covered or handled differently, by a broad range of alternative approaches, as well as different perspectives on evaluation, another challenging aspect due the underlying subjectivity. This paper surveys intelligent poetry generators around a set of relevant axis for poetry generation {--} targeted languages, form and content features, techniques, reutilisation of material, and evaluation {--} and aims to organise work developed on this topic so far.",

Text-alignment is currently the preferred technique for estimating the degree of similarity with existing written works. Due to its dependency on other documents it becomes increasingly tedious and time-consuming to scale up to the growing number of online and offline documents. Thus, this paper aims at studying the use of stylometric features present in a document in order to verify its authorship. Two machine learning algorithms, namely k-NN and SMO, were used to predict the authenticity of the writings. A computer program consisting of 446 features was implemented. Ten PhD theses, split into different segments of 1000, 5000 and 10000 words, were used, totaling 520 documents as our corpus. Our results show that authorship attribution using stylometry method has generated an accuracy of above 90 {\%}, except for 7-NN with 1000 words. We also showed how authorship attribution can be used to identify potential cases of plagiarism in formal writings.",

The vast majority of NLP, its algorithms and software, is created with assumptions particular to living languages, thus neglecting certain important characteristics of largely non-spoken historical languages. Further, scholars of pre-modern languages often have different goals than those of living-language researchers. To fill this void, the CLTK adapts ideas from several leading NLP frameworks to create a novel software architecture that satisfies the unique needs of pre-modern languages and their researchers. Its centerpiece is a modular processing pipeline that balances the competing demands of algorithmic diversity with pre-configured defaults. The CLTK currently provides pipelines, including models, for almost 20 languages.",
